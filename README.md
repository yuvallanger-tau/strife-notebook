Introduction
------------

[the lingua franca of quorum sensing]
Quorum sensing is the ability of bacteria to sense their own concentration.
When in small numbers, quorum sensing receptors are not activated,but when
a critical threshold is achieved, these receptors cause production of
"public goods" that are only beneficial when produced in unison.
In gram positive bacteria, related species
[How much related is related? issue#1] exhibit
high diversity of their quorum sensing machinery. A proprosed model
that explains how such diversity forms introduces an evolutionary ratchet
in which the order of divergence in QS signal or receptor matters. (Avigdor Eldar et el., 2011)
